# Testing the System Activities

## Question 1
### - Compare unit testing, integration testing and system testing below.

- A: Unit testing consists of testing individual functions using basic assertions/functions. This is necessary for the use of individual components or functions to work as expected. This helps developers understand innacuracies in code before the main testing/development process is initiated. Integration testing on the other hand, similarly tests these however in relation with eachother. The goal in doing so is ensuring combined parts interact effectively in the program and do not hinder any other processes which may be initiated by another function. Finally, system testing is the final phase of testing the system, as we test the entire system with not only a few functions together or individual functions but the finished product, ensuring that it works before it is released under real-world conditions and is ready for deployment.
